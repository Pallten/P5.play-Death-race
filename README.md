# Death Race

Death Race is a two player prototype game built with p5.js and p5play. Players control cars, pick up ability boxes, and use momentum based interactions to outplay each other.

The project explores physics driven gameplay, where object momentum plays a central role. Unlike many similar games, movement and collisions are not heavily constrained, which makes the mechanics suitable for experimentation and reuse.

This project is currently a prototype.

## Gameplay Overview

Two players compete by driving cars around the map and collecting boxes that grant temporary abilities. The game emphasizes physics based motion, collisions, and emergent behavior rather than fixed animations.

The codebase is intentionally flexible so that others can reuse parts of the physics, movement, or ability systems in their own projects.
